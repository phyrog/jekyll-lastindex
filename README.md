# jekyll-lastindex

You want your index page to be your latest blog post? Just use this plugin.

## Usage

Copy the `last_index.rb` file into your `_plugins` folder and you're all set.
It will copy the rendered version of the latest entry in any collection to
`<collection_name>/index.html`, as well as the latest post to `/index.html`.

**Warning**: This plugin overwrites your rendered `index.html` file.
